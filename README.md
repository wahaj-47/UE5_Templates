UE_5.0.3 Template files

I do not claim to own any of this content, it is all content given to users in Unreal Engine 4.27.2 that I have
converted to work with Unreal Engine 5.0.3. 

To setup the template:

Unzip & move the above template folders to your epic games template folder.

By default this is located at C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.0\Templates

HOWEVER if you have moved the standard install location it will be located where you put it

Restart your UE5 and find the template under 'games' menu.
